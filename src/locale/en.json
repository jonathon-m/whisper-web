It also means that the transcription will be slow or fail if your computer/smartphone is not powerful enough to perform it.\n\nIn the settings (bottom right corner), you can pick among different models and various quantisation levels. A smaller model with a lower quantisation will be faster but make more mistakes. By default, Scriptless uses small models but you can try a bigger one and see if it works on your device.\n\nFor most languages, it is best to use <4>OpenAI's official models</4> (Multilingual)."
